                <p class = "info">We are Team #6996 – Koalafied, a rookie FIRST® Robotics Competition team based at Pembroke School. FIRST® stands for “For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology”. Our team is made up of students from Pembroke School, with ages ranging from 12 to 18 years old.
                <br><br>
                Although our team is new to the competition, we have two members with prior experience in the FRC. A few team members also have some basic background knowledge in programming. Our team demonstrates a wide range of ethnic backgrounds and gender diversity, which leads to many different perspectives and ideas.
                <br><br>
                Our purpose in creating a robotics team is, first and foremost, to enjoy doing something that interests us. All members of the team are passionate and enthusiastic towards STEM (science, technology, engineering, and maths). We love learning and we believe that participating in the FRC is a fantastic method of learning skills in STEM subjects.
                <br><br>
                By participating in the program, our members receive much more than knowledge in robotics. They are able to get a real experience in areas of STEM, make many new friends, and gain valuable skills that are likely to be taken with them for the rest of their lives.</p>
