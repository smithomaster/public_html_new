The team quickly began learning about robotics and all of the things that are needed to maintain a successful team, such as fundraising, media and, obviously, how to build and program a robot!<br><br>The team decided upon the name "Team Koalafied", registered with FIRST, and then started preparing for their first season of the FIRST Robotics Competition.</p>

                <p class = "news">Team Koalafied #6996 competed in the International FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) Southern Cross Regional in Sydney Olympic Park last Sunday 11 to Tuesday 13 March 2018.
<br><br>
Although we were novices to the FRC, We provided stiff competition to world championship teams from Sydney, Singapore, India and Taiwan, working our way through the qualifiers and finals, only to be narrowly beaten in the grand final series by the top seeded alliance.
<br><br>
We were recognised for our outstanding achievements by winning the "Rookie All Stars Award", which allows our team to now compete in the World Championships to be held in Houston, Texas later in April 2018.
<br><br>
As a further accolade, team captain, Amber Kraczkowska was one of two individuals selected from the approximately 300 high school students who took part in the event, with the prestigious "Deans List Award", which recognises leaders in the international robotics championship event.

                <p class = "news">Team Koalafied came to the Houston championships with the main goal to be a competitive team with a competitive robot in our first year, first attempt and we did just that. We had our fully functional robot with new and updated parts, ready and raring to go after the first day of unpacking the crate and updating the robot. We had multiple upgrades to the robot that we had manufactured in Adelaide and flown to Houston.  <br><br>
We had 10 qualification matches all through the second and third days. We knew that some of our games would be very difficult, especially when some of the opponents had taken part in the competition for 20 years! Because of this, our main goal was to impress other teams in an attempt to be selected in the finals for our division. This strategy was successful as we were selected by the eighth alliance captain in first round selection - which is a huge accomplishment for the team. On top of this we also finished as the top seated rookie team in our division.<br><br>
Now that we were competing with the top 10% of teams in the world, the whole team was pretty excited and incredibly nervous. The nervousness was because, although we had been selected for the finals, we were facing off with the number one alliance for the quarter finals. We started the first of two quarter finals optimistically but had a close defeat. We put up a good fight but lost, mostly because of one of our opponents, madtown robotics, had a very efficient autonomous mode that easily claimed the scale in the first 15 seconds. While we did have difficulty playing against our very capable opponents, overall we were the highest scale scoring rookie team which is a very impressive achievement. We did ultimately lose our first and second quarter finals, knocking us out of the competition.
