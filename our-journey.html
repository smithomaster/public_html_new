The team quickly began learning about robotics and all of the things that are needed to maintain a successful team, such as fundraising, media and, obviously, how to build and program a robot!<br><br>The team decided upon the name "Team Koalafied", registered with FIRST, and then started preparing for their first season of the FIRST Robotics Competition.</p>

                <p class = "news">In March 2018, Team Koalafied embarked on their first competitive venture: the Southern Cross Regional 2018. With everyone having built the robot over the 6 weeks of the build season, spirits were high and everyone couldn't wait to begin. The team performed well throughout the Sydney Regional, getting the no. 15 spot in the Qualifying rounds. The team was then picked to be in an alliance, where we made our way throught the semi finals and quarter finals up until the final, where we were runners-up to the winning alliance. <br><br>Despite not getting to the World Championships by winning the Sydney event, we won the "Rookie All-Stars" award, which meant that we could then go to the World Championships in Houston, Texas, in April.</p>

                <p class = "news">In April 2018, after being awarded the Rookie All Stars award at the Southern Cross Regional, Team Koalafied competed in the FIRST Robotics Competition World Championships in Houston, Texas. At the World Champs, the team was placed in the Roebling division, where the team was ranked no. 30 in the qualifying round out of 67 teams from all around the globe. Koalafied were then picked in the no. 8 alliance to play in the finals, where they unfortunately dropped out in the quarter finals. Getting to the quarter finals, however, is an outstanding effort for a first-year team in the competition.</p>
