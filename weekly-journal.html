He also showed us a video showing how their software can analyse a view from a car camera and identify all the objects in the video – pedestrians, other vehicles, the curb, the road, buildings etc. Once he left some mentors showed the students a prototype for the basketball shooter. this week the media team is doing a huge array of different jobs that have been dealt out to a mentor and a student to work on such as writing letters to sponsors and planning things such as our open day and our quiz night.</p>
