                <h1 class= "info">Lessons learned from Houston and the 2018 Season</h1> 
                <h2 class = "info">Importance of working as a coherent team</h2>
                <p class = "news">Working coherently as a team is fundamental to the success of any FIRST Robotics team which was made 
                most apparent to us by the scale of the operation we must undertake. We learnt how to coordinate the 
                subteams effectively as well as getting along with each other. The FIRST experience allowed us to make 
                new friends as well as developing our social skills in outreach events. This allows tasks to be 
                completed in the most efficient manner in order to allocate time for any unexpected circumstances.

                <h2 class = "info">Dealing with the unexpected</h2>

                <p class = "news">From mechanical difficulties we learnt how to deal with the unexpected and improvise with what we had access to. 
                From having unexpected events happen with the robot we had to communicate with each other and create a flexible 
                plan to work around the difficulties. An example would be a design for the robot not working and having the tenacity, 
                flexibility, and communication skills to create a new solution together as a team. Dealing with the unexpected 
                developed our problem solving skills as we had to create inventive solution to work around problems. </p>
                
                <h2 class = "info">Learning to Manage Time, Stress and Frustration</h2>
                
                <p class = "news">As is normal with a FIRST Robotics Competition team, our season was filled with moments of stress and frustration 
                including failures during matches and strict time schedules when building a second competition robot. We gradually 
                developed our ability after making mistakes and learning from them to handle such stresses and to continue 
                performing at our best. Learning to deal with the stress and frustration when things don’t pan out was a vital part 
                in maintaining a functional team structure, allowing us to build and compete effectively during the Southern Cross 
                Regional and Houston World Championship. Learning these skills does not only allow us to be successful as a team but 
                also allows us to grow as individuals as well.</p>

                <h2 class = "info">Professionalism in the workplace</h2>

                <p class = "news">Professionalism in the workplace is a lesson we learned over the build season. As the season 
                progressed, the value of being graciously professional became more apparent. Being professional to us now means 
                being able to stay on task, be courteous and aware of our actions. This allowed us to get work done on time, be 
                efficient with our time and less friction within our workflow.</p>

                <h2 class = "info">Money</h2>

                <p class = "news">This build season we learnt many things about real-world engineering. We learnt the “good stuff”, 
                you know, how AWESOME building robots is and the amazing feeling when what you’ve imagined comes to life. However, 
                we also learnt that no matter how crazy your ideas are, you need money to first register in the competition, purchase 
                parts, pay for outreach events, and support the team. Although we struggled with finding sponsors initially, we used 
                the “apply to everyone” technique and managed to raise AU$51,500 before our competition. Financial management was 
                crucial in our team’s performance and is something we will definitely need in future years to pursue world domination.</p> 

                <h2 class = "info">Be innovative but realistic</h2>

                <p class = "news">Although many of us within the team could and did put forward many radical ideas, it was quickly 
                apparent that our success relied on both innovation combined with a good sense of our abilities. Although we could have 
                spent our entire build season developing an insane swerve drive, it would not have been beneficial due to our lack of 
                knowledge prior to the build season as a rookie team. Finding appropriate areas for innovation and knowing our 
                capabilities allowed for a successful robot to be constructed without implicating unnecessary stress.</p>

                <h2 class = "info">Sponsors and mentors are important</h2>

                <p class = "news">Although we as students built the robot, without extensive help from mentors and sponsors in 
                providing the necessary knowledge and monetary support, none of the things we accomplished would have been possible. 
                The unitary cohesion between the team members allowed for a reasonably productive build season as team members can 
                perform tasks to their highest ability. Knowing how to use a drill press is pretty cool too.</p>

                <h2 class = "info">Application of knowledge to real world applications</h2>

                <p class = "news">lthough one can read and memorize everything to do with a tool or a piece of software, being able 
                to go from pen and paper to building a robot is a whole challenge in itself. Although we may all know what an allen 
                key was once told about it but the intricacies of using the tool efficiently cannot be taught without first hand 
                experience. Partaking in the First Robotics Competition allowed us to apply the knowledge taught to us by mentors and 
                learn real world applications of theory.</p>

                <h2 class = "info">Team structure and distribution of workload</h2>

                <p class = "news">Our team came into the competition with only a few members with previous experience or knowledge 
                which meant the workload was distributed unevenly. Some subteams also lacked members such as the media team which 
                lead to extensive pressure and stress being placed upon them. However, as the team’s skills and knowledge developed, 
                the workflow was streamlined as the workload could be distributed evenly amongst members. Members from other teams with 
                interest in media was also redistributed to other teams in order to alleviate some of the stress.</p>

                <h1 class = "info">Captain's Statement</h1>
                <p class = "news">Our visit to Houston, Texas to participate in the FRC World Championships was an unforgettable experience. It was a whirlwind of emotions for me, from the stress in the pit area, to driving in our Roebling division; from being inspired and honoured to be a Dean’s List finalist to spending time with my team. But most of all, I enjoyed being around others who understood and embodied the values of FIRST.
                <br><br>
                Being in FIRST for me is not about building robots or creating the perfect machine. These things are just toys. FIRST to me is about inspiring students across the world to pursue their dreams. I believe in teaching others the skills they need to change the world. No thought is too wild, no dream is too crazy, and no career is too impossible.
                <br><br>
                We are a team – and this means we support each other always, no matter the situation. The bond that holds us together is immune to gender inequality, to racial discrimination, and to bias. We are held together by a sense of unity knowing that what we do serves the purpose of changing the world and of exposing students to what they could achieve to cause a STEAM revolution.
                <br><br>
                Our time at champs is indescribable, though I’m sure the others writing this newsletter would disagree. I loved the competitive atmosphere and will never forget the wonder on our faces as we first entered the George R. Brown Convention centre. We explored all the exhibits in the Innovation Faire and raised the roof from the stands with our cheering.
                <br><br>
                I could not be prouder of this amazing group of students who believed in themselves, each other, and absolutely smashed the champs. What can I say? We nailed it. We displayed such gracious professionalism and performed at such a high level for a first year team. The students all learned so much and I strongly believe they serve as a bright hope for the future of science and technology leaders. I can’t wait to see what we do next.
